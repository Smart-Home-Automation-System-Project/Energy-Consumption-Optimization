1. Smart Auto-Shutdown Rules
TV:

Trigger: Turn off after 30 minutes of no motion detected in living room.

Why: To prevent energy waste when no one is watching.

Microwave:

Trigger: Turn off after 5 minutes of no interaction (no button press or use).

Why: To avoid unnecessary power consumption.

Washing Machine / Dishwasher:

Trigger: Turn off after the cycle completes if no door interaction within a set time (e.g., 5 minutes).

Why: Stops devices running unnecessarily after a cycle ends

2. High Energy Usage Alerts
TV:
Trigger: Alert if daily TV consumption exceeds forecasted value by Prophet.
Why: Detects abnormal energy usage.

Microwave:
Trigger: Alert if microwave usage exceeds forecasted kWh or run time.
Why: Identifies inefficient or excessive use.

Refrigerator:
Trigger: Alert if daily compressor ON-time exceeds Prophet's forecast.
Why: Detects operational inefficiency.

Washing Machine / Dishwasher:
Trigger: Alert if daily usage exceeds Prophet forecast or runs longer than predicted cycle duration.
Why: Identifies overuse or double cycles.

Overall Power Consumption:
Trigger: Alert if total daily energy usage exceeds forecasted household consumption by Prophet.
Why: Warns about unexpected spikes in total energy use.

============================================================================================
Dynamic Load Control
Monitor Total Power Usage:

Track the total energy consumption in real time from all devices in the home.

Set a Threshold:

If the total household load exceeds 3 kW, automatically turn off non-essential devices.

Priority List (High to Low):

Fridge (Always running)

Lights

Heater

Water Heater

Microwave, Washing Machine, Dishwasher (Lowest priority)

Why: This ensures that your home doesnâ€™t exceed the power capacity and helps prioritize the essential devices while cutting power to less critical devices.
